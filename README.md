# Multi-Core Process Scheduler

A Java-based simulation of a multi-core execution system with master-slave architecture. This project implements process scheduling (Round Robin, SJF), shared memory management, and task execution monitoring. Features include variable assignments, arithmetic operations, and real-time process tracking.

## Features

- **Process Scheduling**: Implements Round Robin and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithms.
- **Shared Memory Management**: Manages shared memory among processes.
- **Task Execution Monitoring**: Monitors task execution in real-time.
- **Variable Assignments and Arithmetic Operations**: Supports variable assignments and arithmetic operations.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moussa101/Multi-Core-Process-Scheduler.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd Multi-Core-Process-Scheduler
Compile the project:
javac -d bin src/**/*.java
Run the project:
java -cp bin main.MainClass
Usage
Configure the scheduler settings in the configuration file (if applicable).
Run the main class to start the scheduler.
Monitor the process execution and shared memory management through the provided interface.
